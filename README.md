# Smoke Detection Matting Methods: 
Currently this is the storage space for the Matlab code and the paper and source code for matting photos containing smoke with a linear assumption. 

I hope to be able to in the next couple weeks update this with an iPython notebook which will include the code explicitly and well as incorporate all of the theory in the paper. My hope in this would be that people who are working on this problem would easily be able to extend the work we have presented. 


This work was originally for STATS 757 with visiting professor Dr. Raul Rojas. 

Great thanks to both Dr. Rojas for the wonderful semester as well as Tian, Li et al for the clearly written paper and being gracious enough to share their dataset with us to perform PCA.

If you're interested in working on this and desire more of the data than what I've posted here, please email me! (duncanscottwilson@ymail.com) the seismology lab gave us more data than we could handle!
