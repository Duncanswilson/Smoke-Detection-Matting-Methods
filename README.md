# Smoke Detection Matting Methods: 
Currently this is the storage space for the Matlab code and the paper and source code for matting photos containing smoke with a linear assumption. 

I hope to be able to in the next couple weeks update this with an ipython notebook which will include the code explicitally and well as incorporate all of the theory in the paper. 

For STATS 757 with visiting professor Raul Rojas.
